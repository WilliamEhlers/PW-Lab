# Basic Text Analysis Application

## Project Overview
This project implements a basic text analysis tool to preprocess articles and analyze word frequencies. The application processes text files on a specific topic, removes stop words, calculates basic statistics, and ranks words by frequency.

## Milestone 1: Preprocessing Text Files

### Features:
- **Stop Words Removal**: Removes common words like "and", "but", etc.
- **Basic Statistics**: Calculates the number of words and sentences.
- **Word Frequency Ranking**: Ranks words based on how often they appear in the text.

### Setup:
1. **Articles**: Store articles on the same topic in a folder as `.txt` files.
2. **Stop Words**: Use a `stopwords.txt` file with a list of words to ignore during processing. [Example list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words).

### Usage:
1. **Run `Main.java`**: It will prompt you to choose a file from a directory.
2. **Preprocessing**: The selected file will be processed, displaying statistics and word rankings.
